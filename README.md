# On the formalization of Asynchronous First Passage Algorithms

Abstract: The formalization of First Passage schemes is revisited and the emerging of a conceptual contradiction is underlined.
We then show why, despite such a contradiction, the numerical results are not explicitly affected. Through a different
formalization of the problem, we recast the current principles of the algorithm in a more solid conceptual framework,
and numerical evidence gives further justification to our claims.
